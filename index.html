<div>I'm tjkr0wn, an iOS security researcher. I do things like reverse engineering some of Apple's proprietary boot-chain code or exploiting security vulnerabilities.</div>
    
<div>My current focus is on Apple devices (both hardware and software), but I'm open to expanding my attack surface
  to other ecosystems.</div>
  
<div>-> What got you started in security research?</div>
 
<div>I saw all this buzz about "oob_timestamp". Before I knew it, I was messing with iOS hacking in my free time.</div>
  
<div>-> Where can I find some of your research?</div>
  
<div>I've got quite a few cool bugs and projects that I haven't revealed yet, but I hope to soon enough.
My public projects and exploits are most likely going to be on my GitHub. I also like to show others my cool findings in the "Hack Different" communnity.</div>
  
<div>-> What do you reverse the most?</div>
  
<div>I'm spending lots of time hand-reversing or sifting through a kernelcache, iBoot, secureROM, or SEPROM assembly.</div>

<div>-> Can I contact you?</div>
